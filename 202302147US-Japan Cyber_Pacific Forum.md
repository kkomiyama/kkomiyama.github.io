## 事前に送付された質問
Held with support from the US Embassy Tokyo, this first virtual event will examine recent developments in US-Japan cybersecurity cooperation in the wake of increasing severity and frequency of cyberattacks amid the unprovoked war in Ukraine and rising geo-technological competition in the Indo-Pacific. Following the outcomes of the US-Japan Security Consultative Committee(注 2+2のこと) meeting and the signing of the Memorandum of Cooperation on Cybersecurity, the online forum will assess how both allies can improve operational collaboration at the policy, tactical, and strategic levels under Japan's active cyber defense and the US Cyber Strategy of Persistent Engagement.

The online session will also probe the implications of the rapid shift in US and Japan's cyber defense and security policy to the private sector. Given the commercial sector's growing oversight in managing and operating critical national infrastructures, the virtual discussion will also assess the opportunities and challenges between the government and industry to improve threat information sharing and cyberattack disclosures amid diverging national security and commercial interests.

Our confirmed speakers for this event are:

Emily Goldman, Ph.D, Strategist at the US Cyber Command
Koichiro Komiyama, Director of Global Coordination Division JPCERT/CC
Michael Karimian, Director of Digital Diplomacy Asia Pacific at Microsoft
Mark Manantan, Pacific Forum's Director of Cybersecurity and Critical Technologies, will lead the panel discussion.

Below are questions for the discussion:

Questions for Dr. Goldman
1) What are the most recent and significant events shaping the US cybersecurity posture?
2) What are the opportunities and challenges that the US Cyber Command have encountered in implementing the US Cyber Strategy of Persistent Engagement as well as related initiatives like the Hunt forward from a policy, technical, and strategic standpoint?
3) Given the legal, policy, and technical differences in the cybersecurity posture between the US and Japan, how can both allies achieve better policy and operational coordination in launching joint-cyber operations?
4) As the US adopts a more offensive stance towards its cyber operations, if any, what are the concrete steps the US government has been undertaking to maintain trust and confidence among its close allies like Japan?
5) How does the private sector perceive the US Cyber Strategy of Persistent Engagement? Are there any friction points that need to be addressed?

3) What are the implications of the US cyber strategy of Persistent Engagement and Japan's possible pursuit of active cyber defense from the private sector on companies like Microsoft?
